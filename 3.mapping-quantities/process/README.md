Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

Chart 01. From 1960-1964 there was the greatest spike in total nuclear testing across all the countries.

Chart 02. The majority of tests were done underground in consideration of total nuclear testing between all countries.

Chart 03. By comparing the locations of both United States as well as Russia's nuclear testing, there seems to be a trend of initially starting with atmospheric testing, and with the onset of years transitioning more to underground and finally focusing on solely lab testing.

The external data source I'll be incorporating is the analysis of fertility rate growth or decline over the years.
